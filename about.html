			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<article>
				<img class="main" src="http://claymeart.com/images/img_0212%20-%20version%203-u6012.png">Unlike most crafters out there, I was not initially interested in crafting or DIYing. I was never creative or artistic, at least not with my hands. The genesis for my creativity was time; time to let my imagination wander and think how I could use the hours and days to create something new, something beautiful and extraordinary.<br /><br />My first creations started out with various clay and salt dough models and were not satisfactory from an artistic slant. It was when I came upon DecoClay that I was able to let the creative juices flow, and it thus gave me the ability to create the many variations of flower bouquets and arrangements which now adorn my portfolio. The rest as they say is history. What was a hobby has become a dream. What was once a dream has now blossomed into ClayMeArt.
