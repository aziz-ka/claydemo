			<h2>About Artist</h2>
			<article>
				<img class="picture" src="pictures/about/venera-claymaert-owner-and-designer.jpg" alt="ClayMeArt owner and artist Venera">It all began from the moment my husband took me to a local craft store for the first time. Where I was born and raised there weren&apos;t any specialized stores for DIYers and artists. Thus, I was never really into crafting or DIYing while growing up. Walking in I was stunned by the variety of products and felt as if I was a kid in the candy store wanting to try everything. For some reason the very first thing I got my hands on was polymer clay. Since that day, clay sculpting has been part of my life and I enjoy evry bit of it.<br /><br />My first creations started out with various clay and salt dough models. They were not perfect, but it kindled a spark. It was when I came across DecoClay that I began crafting clay flowers which now adorn my <a class="crosslinks" href="shop.html">portfolio</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.
